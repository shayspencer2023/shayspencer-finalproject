            <p>QuizQuestions was created in December 2022 for Shay S.'s final project in the 2022-2023 Computer Science class. The initial plan was to create a news website, with a page for people to write and post their own story. However, you could not create new HTML pages with just base visual studio, so the project idea was abandoned in favour of this website. Starting in mid December, the website was completed on January 17th.<br><br> Inspiration for our four quizes came from a variety of tests about different subjects, with the questions being planned in a google sheets before hand. Once a mechanism for calculating the results from the quiz was created, the questions were put in place. Side pages were created, and the website was decorated!<br><br>Now, the site is free to explore, with many pages to visit and many different results to get on our five quizes. Have fun exploring this site!</p>
