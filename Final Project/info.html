            <p>Each one of our four quizes has 20 questions, each of these questions having five multiple choice options, representing a whopping 400 total multiple choice answers.<br><br>In total, 330 Java Script functions are used to record and calculate information on the results of the test, with 116 CSS stylers used to bring style to each page.<br><br>The Job and Travel quiz work by taking in your input and assigning a score between 2 and -2, depending on how much you agree or disagree with the question. These scores are then added up to give you your final score! There are 36 possible results for the Travel and Job quizes combined.<br><br>The History Quiz, on the other hand, works more like a  traditional quiz. Only the correct answers have a function, a function that sets a variable to 1. At the end, these variables are all added together to get a final score. The questions you got wrong, or missed, will automatically have a value of zero, meaning they are never counted in the score.<br><br>The IQ quiz modifies the formula for the traditional History quiz. Instead of only one answer having a function, all answers have a function, with the correct answer boosting your total score and a wrong answer decreasing it, with the size of the boost/decrease being determined by the difficulty of the question.<br><br>That is just a rundown of how these quizes work!
